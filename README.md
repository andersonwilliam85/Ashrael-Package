# Ashrael-Package

The Ashrael-Package is a suite of modules designed to enhance gameplay for the **Avatar MUD** (avatar.outland.org:3000) by adding new commands, automation features, and quality-of-life improvements. Tailored for players seeking to streamline their experience, the package includes tools to assist with adventuring, character switching, and item tracking.

## Features

   - **Status Checks:** Quickly view adventure mode status, recovery mode, and current configuration.

### 2. **VoidWalker (Upcoming)**
   - **Voidwalking Between Characters:** Allows seamless transitions between alts with custom thematic messages.
   - **Character Status Tracking:** Stores basic stats (health, mana, inventory) and the last room visited.
   - **Voidgaze Command:** Provides a list of all characters with their status and location, along with a void-themed message.
   - **Item Search Across Characters:** Easily locate items within the inventories of all your characters.
   - **Autologin Animation:** Animates the experience of “slipping through the void” to add immersion while hiding login screens.
   - **Custom Login/Logout Messaging:** Transitions include descriptive messages like “You slip into the void…”
